                <h6>The single best way to get better at stand-up comedy is by getting on stage and performing – and the second best way is by watching or listening to other people do stand-up. But there's much more to the craft than that. Learning how to write jokes, how to build your persona, how to practice, and all about why people laugh can help you add direction to your sets and mature into a more knowledgeable and skilled comic. On top of that, learning the history of art as well as some more esoteric stuff about joke theory can give you the edge over the other two-dozen people ahead of you in line at the open mic.</h6>
                <h6>As a comedian who also writes a lot about comedy, I've read big piles of stuff by comedians, about comedians, and about how to become a comedian. Here are my very best picks – the books I return to over and over again, and the books that helped me understand everything I know about jokes and joking.</h6>

                The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive.
                
                Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.
                
                Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.
                
                Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him</h6>
